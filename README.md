## web_scraping_challenge

mission_to_mars.ipynb is the jupyter note book that has the code to scrape the requested data.

I used nbconvert to get a workable python script. I renamed this script to scrape_mars.py as requested.

the mongoDB database is "scraping_challenge" and the collection is "scraped".

The image ofr my final application is in the images folder.

I have included the index.html, the app.py, and the scrape_mars.py even though they are not requested on the instructions.
